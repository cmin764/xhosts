            Hosts file editor with web support

    With this cross-platform software you can rapidly edit
(in both CLI and GUI mode) your hosts file by adding or removing mappings.
If you don't know what hosts is, you can read about it here:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file). Also you can easily search
for sites within a search engine just inside the program.

    To be able to run and use this program you must have installed
Python with Tkinter (python-tk) and access xhosts in super user mode (sudo/su)
or allowing other users to modify hosts (Linux: sudo chmod o+w /etc/hosts,
Windows: Run as Administrator or disable antivirus).
